        <p-about>
          I'm Andrejs Dvoskins, a first-year student at Fontys. Originally from
          Latvia, my primary language is Russian. I have a strong passion for
          sports, particularly karate, which I've been practicing for ten years.
          Achieving the title of World champion one year ago and achieving the
          European champion title this year have been significant
          accomplishments for me. Currently, I'm immersing myself in the field
          of ICT & Media Design, and this website will serve as a platform to
          document and share my progress in this exciting journey.</p-about>
