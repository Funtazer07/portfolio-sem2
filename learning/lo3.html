        <h1>learning outcome 3: Iterative design</h1>
        <p>In the pursuit of refining my visual creations, I've delved into the realm of professional design tools. Among these, Adobe Photoshop has been instrumental.

            Admittedly, I wasn't initially a Photoshop whiz. However, I encountered a photo of myself against a dark background, prompting me to learn how to cut myself out of it for my portfolio. Thankfully, Photoshop's user-friendly interface made the process relatively straightforward. Through trial and error, I successfully removed the background and seamlessly integrated myself into my portfolio design. It was a learning experience, but one that ultimately proved invaluable.</p>

            <p>
            
            In the spirit of refinement, I've continuously adjusted various visual elements of my portfolio. For instance, I opted to switch the white background of the index page symbols to a bold red hue. This adjustment was made to enhance the overall aesthetic coherence and visual impact of the portfolio.
            
            Whether it's mastering new tools like Photoshop or meticulously refining design elements, I'm committed to an iterative approach that prioritizes continuous improvement and visual appeal.</p>
